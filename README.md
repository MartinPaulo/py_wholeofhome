# py_wholeofhome

This package implements the various calculations for the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) whole-of-home methodology (https://www.nathers.gov.au/whole-of-home). This includes heating/cooling, hot water, cooking and more, but not the core thermal envelope modelling which estimates the heating and cooling demand of a given building.

It's a work-in-progress!

Currently designed to implement Rev 10.1 of the Calculation Method Paper.



This package is not officially affiliated with NatHERS and is not an accredited rating tool. It's intended for research and the creation of other tools that can make use of the underlying methodology.
